#Create a python tha is able to calc. the simple interest given the principle as 50000,rate as 5% and time as 8 years  SI=(p*r*t)/100%
principle= 50000
rate= 5
time= 8
simpleinterest= (principle*rate*time)/100
print("The simple interest is:",simpleinterest )

# Assignment
# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
weight= 78
height= 1.75
heightsquared= height**2
BMI= weight/heightsquared
print("BMI:", BMI)

# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
length= 48
width= 25
Area= length*width
Perimeter= 2*(length+width)
print("Area:", Area)
print("Perimeter", Perimeter)
# Research on python list, tuple and Dictionary Data types.
